# Post Pandemic Flight Analysis (2019 - May 2022)
As an analyst hired by an airline company, my task is to examine the recovery of the airline industry in European countries post-COVID-19. The pandemic caused a significant downturn, leading to a rapid decline in airline operations and passenger numbers. This project evaluates the impact on air travel using data from 2019 to May 2022, with 2019 as the baseline, and provides strategic recommendations for the industry's recovery.

Insight will be provided for there areas
1. Flight Volume Recovery
2. Country-Specific Recovery
3. Average Monthly Growth Rate

# Flight Volume Recovery:
**Overview**:
The following visualization is derived from the original dataset and includes the number of monthly flights from 2019 to May 2022 across European countries. The cleaned dataset, which includes variables such as Year, Month, and Total Flights, can be found [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17356533/monthlyflights.csv).

**North Star Metric**: 
Total Monthly Flights: This metric tracks the number of flights each month to measure overall recovery progress.                       
Month-over-Month Growth Rate: Compares the percentage of flights recovered each month relative to 2019 levels.

**Insights & Findings**:
1. Initial Decline: The data indicates a dramatic drop in flight volumes starting in February 2020. This aligns with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. 
2. Gradual Recovery: From mid-2020, there is a noticeable uptick in flights, reflecting gradual easing of lockdowns and an increase in seasonal travel.
3. Stabilization Phase: Flight volumes stabilized around 500,000 monthly flights for a period, showing a steady but cautious recovery.
4. Significant Increase in 2022: By May 2022, the data reveals a marked increase, with flights nearing 1 million per month. This suggests a significant rebound in travel demand.
5. Approaching Pre-Pandemic Levels: Early 2022 shows a strong upward trend, with monthly flight numbers approaching 1.5 million. This indicates that the industry is nearing full recovery, driven by pent-up demand and eased restrictions.
