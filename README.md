# Post Pandemic Flight Analysis (2019 - May 2022)
As an analyst hired by an airline company, my task is to examine the recovery of the airline industry in European countries post-COVID-19. The pandemic caused a significant downturn, leading to a rapid decline in airline operations and passenger numbers. This project evaluates the impact on air travel using data from 2019 to May 2022, with 2019 as the baseline, and provides strategic recommendations for the industry's recovery.
