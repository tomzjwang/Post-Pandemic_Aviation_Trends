# Post Pandemic Flight Analysis (2019 - May 2022)
### Project Background
As an analyst hired by an airline company, my task is to examine the recovery of the airline industry in European countries post-COVID-19. The pandemic caused a significant downturn, leading to a rapid decline in airline operations and passenger numbers. This project evaluates the post-COVID-19 recovery of the airline industry in Europe, focusing on key countries and overall regional trends, using data from 2019 to May 2022. It highlights recovery trends and provides strategic recommendations for the industry’s recovery.

**Insight will be provided for there areas**
- Flight Volume Recovery (Europe) 
- Recovery in Key Countries (Spain, Germany, France, UK)
- Average Monthly Growth Rate

# Data Structure 
The company’s main database was originally a single comprehensive repository. To optimize data management, it was divided into several smaller, specialized tables. Here’s the structure:
1. [Monthly Flights](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/monthly_flights.csv): Tracks the total number of monthly flights in Europe from January 2019 to May 2022.
2. [Flight Recovery](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/flight_recovery.csv): Compares monthly flight rates to 2019 levels.
3. [Flight Volume](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/flight_volume.csv): Summarizes flight volumes by country between January 2019 and May 2022.
4. [Spain Recovery](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/spain.csv): Details monthly flight rates compared to 2019 for Spain.
5. [Germany Recovery](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/germany.csv): Details monthly flight rates compared to 2019 for Germany.
6. [France Recovery](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/france.csv): Details monthly flight rates compared to 2019 for France.
7. [UK Recovery](https://github.com/tomzjwang/Post_Pandemic_Flight_Trends/blob/main/uk.csv): Details monthly flight rates compared to 2019 for UK.
   
# Executive Summary
**Key Findings**
- Initial Decline: Significant drop in flights starting February 2020.
- Gradual Recovery: Noticeable incrase in mid 2020
- Peak Recovery: Strong upward trend starting July 2021, nearing pre-pandemic levels by May 2022.




**Insights & Findings**:
- Initial Decline: The data indicates a dramatic drop in flight volumes starting in February 2020. This aligns with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. 
- Gradual Recovery: From mid 2020, there is a noticeable uptick in flights, reflecting the gradual easing of lockdowns and an increase in seasonal travel, with some countries reopening their borders.
- Decline Phase: During late 2020, many countries began reintroducing tighter restrictions due to new variants and rising case numbers.
- Significant Increases: Starting from May 2021, flight numbers began to rise significantly as vaccinations became more widespread and countries gradually reopened their borders.
- Approaching Pre-Pandemic Levels: From July 2021 onwards, there 9999was a strong upward trend, with monthly flights reaching 1 million and ultimately breaking 1.25 million by May 2022. This indicates that the industry is nearing full recovery, driven by pent-up demand and eased restrictions.

# Country-Specific Recovery:
These countries have experienced significant air travel activity, with each accounting for over 4 million flights from 2019 to May 2022. Due to their substantial traffic and pivotal roles in European air travel, I will deep dive into the recovery trends and insights for these four countries as shown

**Insights & Findings**:

General Trend:
Across all four countries, there was a significant decline in flight numbers starting in early 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.

Rate of Recovery:
The recovery rates differ between countries. For instance, Germany and France show gradual improvement starting from the second half of 2021, while Spain and the UK exhibit a more erratic recovery pattern with notable fluctuations.

Pre-Pandemic Levels:
By the first half of 2022, no country had fully returned to pre-pandemic flight levels. The UK's flight rates remained approximately 16% below 2019 levels, while Spain showed a closer approach at around 14% below.

Seasonal Impact:
Summer months (July and August) show higher recovery rates in all countries, suggesting increased travel during these periods. Spain, in particular, saw a significant jump during these months.

Quarterly Comparisons:
The second half of 2021 (Q3 and Q4) saw a more substantial recovery in flights compared to the first half of the year. This trend is evident in Germany, France, and Spain.
