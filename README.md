# Post Pandemic Flight Analysis (2019 - May 2022)
As an analyst hired by an airline company, my task is to examine the recovery of the airline industry in European countries post-COVID-19. The pandemic caused a significant downturn, leading to a rapid decline in airline operations and passenger numbers. This project evaluates the impact on air travel using data from 2019 to May 2022, with 2019 as the baseline, and provides strategic recommendations for the industry's recovery.

Insight will be provided for there areas
1. Flight Volume Recovery
2. Country-Specific Recovery
3. Average Monthly Growth Rate

# Flight Volume Recovery:
The following visualization is derived from the original dataset and includes the number of monthly flights from 2019 to May 2022 across European countries. The cleaned dataset, which includes variables such as Year, Month, and Total Flights, can be found [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17356533/monthlyflights.csv), the data illustrating flight recovery percentages is shown in the table below [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17370027/flightrecovery.csv).

**North Star Metric**: 
Total Monthly Flights: This metric tracks the number of flights each month to measure overall recovery progress.                       
Month-over-Month Growth Rate: Compares the percentage of flights recovered each month relative to 2019 levels.

**Insights & Findings**:
1. Initial Decline: The data indicates a dramatic drop in flight volumes starting in February 2020. This aligns with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. 
2. Gradual Recovery: From mid 2020, there is a noticeable uptick in flights, reflecting the gradual easing of lockdowns and an increase in seasonal travel, with some countries reopening their borders.
3. Decline Phase: During late 2020, many countries began reintroducing tighter restrictions due to new variants and rising case numbers.
4. Significant Increases: Starting from May 2021, flight numbers began to rise significantly as vaccinations became more widespread and countries gradually reopened their borders.
5. Approaching Pre-Pandemic Levels: From July 2021 onwards, there was a strong upward trend, with monthly flights reaching 1 million and ultimately breaking 1.25 million by May 2022. This indicates that the industry is nearing full recovery, driven by pent-up demand and eased restrictions.


# Flight Volume Recovery:
These countries have experienced significant air travel activity, with each accounting for over 4 million flights from 2019 to May 2022. Due to their substantial traffic and pivotal roles in European air travel, I will deep dive into the recovery trends and insights for these four countries as shown [by](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17370386/table.csv).
